# HR-Analytics-Power-BI-Project

Objective:
To design and implement a comprehensive HR analytics dashboard utilizing Power BI aimed at enhancing employee performance and reducing attrition rates within the organization.

Description:
This project aims to leverage data-driven insights to improve both employee performance and retention rates within the organization. The HR analytics dashboard created using Power BI will amalgamate various data sources including employee demographics, performance metrics, engagement surveys, historical attrition data, and other relevant HR information.

Key Components and Features of the HR Analytics Dashboard:
. Employee Performance Metrics: Aggregate and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as individual/team productivity, sales performance, project completion rates, and other relevant metrics to identify high-performing employees and areas that require improvement.
. Attrition Analysis: Analyze historical attrition data to identify patterns, trends, and potential causes of employee turnover. Utilize predictive models to forecast attrition risks and identify high-risk groups or departments.
. Interactive and User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allows HR professionals and management to interact with the data dynamically. Incorporate filters, drill-down options, and visualizations that enable easy interpretation and extraction of actionable insights.
. Actionable Recommendations: Generate actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis performed. Provide suggestions for targeted interventions or HR strategies to enhance employee performance and reduce attrition.
